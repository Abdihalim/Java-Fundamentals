Class and object
-----------------
Class is the basic building of Object Oriented Programming.
For example the design of the building is the calass and the real one is the object.
In short the diagram is the class and the actual building is the object.
Again the class is the blueprint of an object, then the object is constructed on memory.

Primitive variables and reference variables

Car gaadhi = new Car();

Examples of Objects
-------------------
Car, Cat, House, Mobile, Dog, Lion, Person.....

Each object has 2 things the properties (Data) and the behaviour.

Properties/attributes of Car (Variables)
-----------------------------
-Colour
-model
-design 
-speed
-Battery
-Lights
-and so on

Behaviour of the Car (Methods)
------------------------------
-Moves
-Starts
-Shuts down
-Makes sound

Example of an object and class
------------------------------
public class Class {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	gaadhi cusub = new gaadhi();
	cusub.start();
	cusub.sound();
	
		
		
		
	}

}
class gaadhi

{
	
	//String color;
	//String design;
	
	void start(){
		System.out.println("isnt started");
	
	}
	void sound(){
		System.out.println("it started");
	}
}
