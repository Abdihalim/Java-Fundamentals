Comparison Operators
----------------------

The == operator tests whether the two operands are equal.
The != operator tests whether the two operands are not equal.
The < operator tests whether the first operand is less than the second operand.
The > operator tests whether the first operand is greater than the second operand.
The <= operator tests whether the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand.
The >= operator tests whether the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand.


Examples 
-----------

Declare 2 integer variabless
d and f

int d = 100;
int f = 33;

System.out.println(d > f);
System.out.println(d==f);
and test all the other operators.
