Constructors
------------
Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object. 
Java constructor is invoked at the time of object creation.
It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object that is why it is known as constructor. 

Rules for creating java constructor
------------------------------------

There are basically two rules defined for the constructor.

    -Constructor name must be same as its class name
    -Constructor must have no explicit return type
Types of java constructors
--------------------------

There are two types of constructors:

    Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
    Parameterized constructor
    
Java Default Constructor
------------------------
A constructor that have no parameter is known as default constructor.

Syntax of default constructor:

    <class_name>(){}  

Example
----------

class monkey{

monkey() {

System.out.println("Monkey is funny");
}

public static void(String argsp[]){
  monkey a = new monkey();
}

Rule: If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
