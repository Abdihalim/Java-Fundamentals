Java static method
------------------

If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.

    A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
    A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
    static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

Example of static method

    //Program of changing the common property of all objects(static field).  
      
    class Student9{  
         int rollno;  
         String name;  
         static String college = "ITS";  
           
         static void change(){  
         college = "BBDIT";  
         }  
      
         Student9(int r, String n){  
         rollno = r;  
         name = n;  
         }  
      
         void display (){System.out.println(rollno+" "+name+" "+college);}  
      
        public static void main(String args[]){  
        Student9.change();  
      
        Student9 s1 = new Student9 (111,"Karan");  
        Student9 s2 = new Student9 (222,"Aryan");  
        Student9 s3 = new Student9 (333,"Sonoo");  
      
        s1.display();  
        s2.display();  
        s3.display();  
        }  
    }
    
    
Another example of static method that performs normal calculation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    //Program to get cube of a given number by static method  
      
    class Calculate{  
      static int cube(int x){  
      return x*x*x;  
      }  
      
      public static void main(String args[]){  
      int result=Calculate.cube(5);  
      System.out.println(result);  
      }  
    }
    
) why java main method is static?
Ans) because object is not required to call static method if it were non-static method, jvm create object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.
3) Java static block

    Is used to initialize the static data member.
    It is executed before main method at the time of classloading.

Example of static block
-----------------------

    class A2{  
      static{System.out.println("static block is invoked");}  
      public static void main(String args[]){  
       System.out.println("Hello main");  
      }  
    }  



Q) Can we execute a program without main() method?

Ans) Yes, one of the way is static block but in previous version of JDK not in JDK 1.7.

    class A3{  
      static{  
      System.out.println("static block is invoked");  
      System.exit(0);  
      }  
    }
