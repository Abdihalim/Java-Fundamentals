Access specifiers (Access modifiers)
------------------------------------
Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Access modifiers are a specific part of programming language syntax used to facilitate the encapsulation of components.

There are 2 access modifiers
   1- class level
   2- Method (member leve)
   
   public: means the project can seen by all the other classes in the same package and others in the same package with java application.
   
   Example 1
   ---------
   
public class Employee {

	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	
		
		
		
		
		
	}
}
// step 1: This class can be seen in the current package
 //step 2: int talefan = 66;
 // try to call the tel from above by writing    hooyo tel = new hooyo(); System.out.println("Hoyo telkedu wa "+tel.talefan); it works (defult)
 // try to add publc int talefan = 66; the run the code again
 // try to add private but this one can be called in the same class as shown here  // publc int talefan = 66; and try to call it.
 // add a method like  private void sleeps() {}
 // try to call from above this wont happen 
 //padd public void sleeps() {}
 // create a variable with protected, protected String timo = "Casaas"; so if its protected it can be called from the same package and the also 
 the inherited ones (child  class).
 
 
 
class hooyo {
	
	int talefan = 66;
	
	
	
}
class aniga extends hooyo{
	
	
		
	}
