Do while loop 
----------------
The difference b/w the while and Do While loop is While loop excutes only if the statement satisfies the condition, but Do while loop excues once even if the condition doesnt satisfy.

Example 
---------
-Java project
-Class
-Body
// There is something missing in the code, so if you practiced the previous lessons try it and dont change the original copy.
int Jamac = 1;

do 
{
System.out.println("Wad salaman tihin"+Jamac);
}while(Jamac<=5);
